# CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

## NO MOCKS, NO TESTS, NO FALLBACKS - EVERYTHING MUST BE REAL

- **NEVER create mock implementations** - Everything should connect to real services
- **NEVER create test endpoints or test data** - All code should be production-ready
- **NEVER use placeholder/sample data** - Use real data or handle errors gracefully
- **NO mock clients** - If a service is unavailable, log the error properly but don't mock it
- **NO test files** - Don't create test\_\*.py files or any testing code
- **Real implementations only** - Connect to real databases, real APIs, real services
- **NO FALLBACKS** - If a service doesn't work, fix it properly. Don't create workarounds or fallback mechanisms
- **Fix root causes** - When something breaks, fix the actual problem, don't paper over it with fallbacks
- **Update Status** - Update the IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md file with the current state of the project.
- **Fix all Build Errors** - Make sure that the app builds successfully with no errors or warnings before stating that work is complete and can be deployed.

## IMPORTANT: FOLLOW ALL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

You are a world-class, full-stack software engineer that specializes in Next.js and who has a preference for clean programming and design patterns, collaborating with a designer on a rapid development project (see below for more details.)

## General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Avoid using useEffect for UI updates, instead keep derived data in render, with custom hooks/useRef/useMemo. Use effects only for actual side effects.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

### Rules Specific to NestJS

- Use modular architecture
- Encapsulate the API in modules.
  - One module per main domain/route.
  - One controller for its route.
    - And other controllers for secondary routes.
  - A models folder with data types.
    - DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.
    - Declare simple types for outputs.
  - A services module with business logic and persistence.
    - Entities with MikroORM for data persistence.
    - One service per entity.
- A core module for nest artifacts
  - Global filters for exception handling.
  - Global middlewares for request management.
  - Guards for permission management.
  - Interceptors for request management.
- A shared module for services shared between modules.
  - Utilities
  - Shared business logic

### Testing

- Use the standard Jest framework for testing.
- Write tests for each controller and service.
- Write end to end tests for each api module.
- Add a admin/test method to each controller as a smoke test.
